INTRODUCTION: 
pykill32 enable users to send signals to a remote (Python) process, in
the Windows 2000/XP operating system.


EXAMPLE:
import signal
import pykill32
 
pykill32.kill(pid, signal.SIGTERM)


There is also a script, kill.py, that emulates POSIX kill(1)
kill.py -s SIGTERM pid


REQUIREMENTS: 
Python 2.4 (http://python.org/)
pywin32 (a recent version)
ctypes (a recent version)
 

LIMITATIONS:
pykill32 assumes that the remote process links to the MSVCR71.dll 
(old the oldest msvcrt.dll) DLL and that the system maps this DLL at
the same address for all processes that use it.

Virtually all Windows programs use the C Runtime library.


TODO:
Check that pykill32 does not do insane things.
