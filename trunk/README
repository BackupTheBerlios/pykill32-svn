INTRODUCTION: 
pykill32 enable users to send signals to a remote (Python) process, in
the Windows 2000/XP operating system.


EXAMPLE:
import signal
import pykill32
 
pykill32.kill(pid, signal.SIGTERM)


There is also a script, kill.py, that emulates POSIX kill(1)
kill.py -s SIGTERM pid


REQUIREMENTS: 
Python 2.4 (http://python.org/)
pywin32 (a recent version)
ctypes (a recent version)
 

LIMITATIONS:
pykill32 assume that the remote process links to the MSVCR71 DLL and
that the system map this DLL at the same address for all processes
that use it.


TODO:
Check that pykill32 does not do insane things.
